      Add support for if/switch expressions
      
      As pointed out in #351.
      
      [SE-0380](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0380-if-switch-expressions.md)
      made it possible to do this, but support was lacking in this repository.
      The fix turned out to be easier than anticipated, simply requiring the
      statement to be added in some new places. Theoretically, it should also
      be renamed, but that would make this a breaking change.
      
      The proposal does not make clear whether labels are permitted on
      expression-position `if` and `switch` statements. This assumes they are
      not, for simplicity.
