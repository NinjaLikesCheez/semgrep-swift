      Bring back support for optional types in constructors
      
      In #353, adding `_parenthesized_type` caused new parse failures where
      the parser now resolved away from `tuple_type` too early. Specifically,
      when parsing an expression like `[(any Foo) ...`, the `tuple_type`
      interpretation must still be valid at that point in the expression in
      case we're about to see a `?`.
      
      The truly robust thing to do would be to support `$.tuple_type` as the
      target of the navigation expression. However, this leads to a large
      number of additional parse failures, as seen in #360. To avoid all of
      that, we add support in the opposite direction: allow `tuple_type` to be
      resolved using `_parenthesized_type`, so that the parser seeing the
      latter does not cause it to invalidate the former.
