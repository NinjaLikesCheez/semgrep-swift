      Don't use the external scanner for `...`
      
      We now have better invalidation of operators in the custom scanner than
      we did when we added the various `.`-prefixed operators. This means we
      can bail out quickly and avoid marking a token incorrectly.
      
      This simplifies downstream handling of `...`, which, in addition to
      being a Swift operator, is also used by Semgrep.
      
      In order to make this happen, we do also have to be a bit more careful
      with `mark_end`. If we're possibly going to emit a `_semi`, we have to
      make sure not to `mark_end`, because we don't want that to be "part of"
      the semi. This theoretically means that if we were chasing a longer
      operator, but failed to find it, and had a shorter operator that was
      `cross_semi`, it would get parsed incorrectly -- but this seems unlikely
      since such a longer operator would be likely to match the
      `custom_operator` pattern to begin with.
      
      Fixes #226
