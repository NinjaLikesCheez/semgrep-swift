      Manually inline `_locally_permitted_modifiers`
      
      See https://github.com/returntocorp/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep/issues/286
      
      When generating a simplified grammar, the `ocaml-tree-sitter` code
      generator forces all hidden nodes to be visible. It appears that hidden
      nodes automatically get marked as `inline`, and that without that
      auto-inlining, the `_locally_permitted_modifiers` rule causes a
      conflict.
      
      Rather than making the semgrep folks work around their conflict, we just
      check the `inline` declaration into the grammar itself so that it sticks
      around in the simplified grammar.
